Keyword Abstractor is a Python-based tool designed to assist researchers in extracting relevant keywords from academic abstracts using the OpenAI API. This tool is particularly beneficial for bibliometric analyses where datasets, such as those exported from the Web of Science, provide abstracts but lack associated keywords.​

🔍 Features

Utilizes OpenAI's advanced language models to extract meaningful keywords from abstracts.

Streamlines the process of preparing data for bibliometric studies.

Enhances datasets by supplementing missing keyword information.

📁 Use Case 

In bibliometric research, comprehensive datasets are crucial. However, platforms like the Web of Science often export records containing abstracts without accompanying keywords. Keyword Abstractor addresses this gap by generating relevant keywords, thereby enriching the dataset and facilitating more robust analyses
